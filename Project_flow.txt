1. Create a git repo and clone it in local. 
2. Create mycode.py and add code to it.(it will save a file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add .-commit-push before initializing dvc.
4. Now we will do "dvc init" (Create .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. Now do mkdir S3 ( Create a new S3 directory)
6. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3
7. Next "dvc add data/"
    Now it will ask to do:(git rm -r --cached "data" and git commit -m "stop tracking data")
    Because initially we were tracking data/ from git So Now we will remove it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do dvc add data/ (Create data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc
9. Now "dvc commit" and "dvc push"
10 . Now git add . and git commit and git push to mark this stage as first version of data 
11. Now we make changes in the data and then again dvc commit and push for the version 2 of data 
12. Agin dvc commit and dvc push
